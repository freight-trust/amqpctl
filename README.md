# amqpctl

`amqpctl` is a command line based client for the AMQP Management protocol. It is written in Go language and tested against [Apache Qpid Dispatch](http://qpid.apache.org/components/dispatch-router/index.html) AMQP router. It should be compatible with all implementations of AMQP Management Working Draft 9.

## Dependencies

`amqpctl` is using [Apache Qpid Proton](http://qpid.apache.org/proton/index.html) as its underlying AMQP client. Apache Qpid Proton has to be installed to use `amqpctl`

## Usage

See `amqpctl --help` for more details about the usage and supported operations.
